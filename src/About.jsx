            <p>
                Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is a beloved superhero from Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962.
                Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.
                These powers include superhuman strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls. He also has a precognitive “spider-sense” that alerts him to danger.
                Using his scientific skills, Peter creates web-shooters that allow him to swing between buildings and capture criminals.
                Despite his extraordinary abilities, Spider-Man is known for his relatable struggles with everyday issues like school, work, and relationships.
                His motto, “With great power comes great responsibility,” reflects his commitment to using his powers for good, inspired by the tragic loss of his Uncle Ben.
